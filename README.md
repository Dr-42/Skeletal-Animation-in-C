# OpenGL Skeletal animation in Pure C

This code based is based on (Skeletal Animation)[https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2020/Skeletal-Animation]

I wanted to implement this in pure C instead of C++, and after weeks of head banging, this is the result.

## Usage

Make sure you have Glew and assimp installed.
To enable the stack trace thingy on windows, follow the additional steps in the stack trace repo (stack trace)[https://github.com/Dr-42/stack_trace]

```console
cargo install builder_cpp
builder_cpp -br
```
